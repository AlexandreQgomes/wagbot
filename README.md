# Wagbot

Wagbot is a chatbot that answers students' & parents' questions about problems at (New Zealand) schools. It's in testing at http://m.me/wagbot. If you'd like to play with it you'll need to be added as a tester. To do that, join the [Friends of Wagbot Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofwagbot/).

This is a [Community Law Wellington & Hutt Valley](http://communitylaw.org.nz) project.
