# Wagbot

Wagbot is an experimental chatbot that answers students' & parents' questions about problems at (New Zealand) schools. It's in testing at http://m.me/wagbot. The people who're testing it chat in the [Friends of Wagbot Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofwagbot/).

This is a [Community Law Wellington & Hutt Valley](http://communitylaw.org.nz) project.
